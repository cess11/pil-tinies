# pil-tinies
Tiny pil scripts. Made for use with www.picolisp.com. 
-----------------------------------------------------
db-controls.l:
These are a few 'call' based functions for some control over the Linux music player DeadBeef (http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/) within pil. 

Usage would be along the lines
:(load "db-controls.l")
:(db-play)
starting deadbeef 0.7.2
:(dbi)
random
starting deadbeef 0.7.2
:

TODO would be to rewrite (dbi) a little but I probably can't be bothered.
